##Chuck Norris Jokes

This is my first React app. It uses the Chuck Norris jokes API to display a random joke about Chuck Norris at the click of a button

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

###To run the project

run:

`npm install`

then,

`npm start`
