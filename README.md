##Chuck Norris Jokes

This is my first React app. It uses the [Chuck Norris jokes API](http://www.icndb.com/api/) to display a random joke about Chuck Norris at the click of a button

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

###To run the project

From within the project folder run:

`npm install`

then,

`npm start`
